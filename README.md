## Description

This is yet another app to help you take notes in case you already don't have enough of those. The app allows you to add a title and a body of text for your note, and then saving it adds it to the left hand side list. Additionally, users also have the abiliyt to delete completed notes by pressing the bin icon. This app would probably be considered minimal. You take notes, you delete, you move on.
